        <p>This ForestWatchers application asks people if a specific area is too cloudy to
        search for deforested areas.</p>
        
        <p>The volunteer will be able to answer: yes and no, and the application provides
        a measure tool to analyze if the clouds cover more than 50% of the area</p>.
        
        <p>Once a raster image has been completely analyzed, it will be possible to
        discard those cloudy areas, and focus the efforts where there are clean areas.</p>
