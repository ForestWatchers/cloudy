Cloud Filtering
==============

This ForestWatchers application asks people if a specific area is too cloudy to
search for deforested areas.

The volunteer will be able to answer: yes and no, and the application provides
a measure tool to analyze if the clouds cover more than 50% of the area.

Once a raster image has been completely analyzed, it will be possible to
discard those cloudy areas, and focus the efforts where there are clean areas.
